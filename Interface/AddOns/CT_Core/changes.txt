CT_Core (4.0302) 2012-02-13
- Fixed a bug: When a window was closed, CT_Core was forcing all bags to close even if the "Close all bags" option for the window was disabled. This was affecting windows for which the game does not normally close all bags, such as the trade and auction house windows.

CT_Core (4.0301) 2011-11-27
- Updated for the WoW 4.3 patch.

- Updated CT_Library.lua to version 4.0100.
- The various "open all bags" options have been updated to work with WoW 4.1 changes.

CT_Core (4.005) 2011-01-04
- If the Objectives options are enabled in CT_Core, the Objectives window will now be shown if you are not tracking anything when the game adds a "quest completed" frame to the Objectives window.

CT_Core (4.004) 2010-10-31
- A side effect of the CT_Core 4.003 bag changes was that if the backpack was already open before you opened a merchant's window, then the game's CloseAllBags() function left the backpack open when you closed the merchant's window. If the 'Close all bags...' option is enabled, CT_Core will now close the backpack if it is still open after CloseAllBags() has finished.

CT_Core (4.003) 2010-10-27
- Fixed a 'SetWidth()' error that was occuring if the CT_Core "Objectives" options were enabled, the "Can change width of window" option was enabled, and the size of the objectives window was not changed before logging out or reloading the UI.

Tooltip Relocation
- The "On mouse" tooltip location that was changed in CT_Core 3.309, has been renamed to "On mouse (2)".
- A new tooltip location named "On mouse (1)" has been added which is similar to the "On mouse" location that CT_Core was using prior to version 3.309 (including immediate tooltip hiding). This version includes a workaround for the update issue related to the health bar shown below a unit's tooltip. Anyone that had "On mouse" selected will automatically be using the new "On mouse (1)" location.

CT_Core (3.314)
- Fixed a nil value error that was occurring for some people when they received a whisper.
- Added "Real ID whisper" to the sticky chat options.
- Added an option to override the default resize limits of the chat frames.

- Added options to adjust the opacity of the chat frame tabs.
- Added option to enable/disable the bottom right chat frame resize button.

- Fixed errors related to player notes.
- Added an option to control chat frame clamping. You can use the game's default setting, allow moving to screen edges, or allow moving off screen. If you move a chat frame so that can't see or access it, use the 'Game default' setting to make it reappear on screen.

CT_Core (3.311)
- Updated for the WoW 3.3.5 patch.
- Added an option to hide the friends button that is shown beside the main chat frame.
- Removed the option to enable chat scrolling via the mousewheel. This option is now built into the game's default UI and can be toggled via the game's Interface options in the 'Social' category.
- Added an option to enable the use of the Shift and Ctrl keys when chat scrolling. Shift + Mousewheel will scroll to the top/bottom of the chat frame, and Ctrl + Mousewheel will scroll one page up/down.
- Added an option to control the position of the chat frame input box when the option to display it at the top of the chat frame is enabled.

CT_Core (3.310)

Chat:

- Right clicking on the 'On Anchor' mode's anchor frame now properly updates the value displayed in the CT_Core options window.
- Added options to hide the tooltip when the game begins to make the tooltip fade. It is not possible to change the amount of time before the tooltip starts to fade.

CT_Core (3.309)

Objectives
- Fixed an issue that was causing the minimized objectives window to be placed in the wrong spot for previous users who had not resized or dragged the window since the 3.3.3 patch.

Tooltip relocation
- Fixed an issue when anchoring tooltips on the mouse that was causing the health bar under a unit's tooltip to sometimes display at full health when the unit was injured.
- Added the ability to use top, right, bottom, or left anchor points for tooltips.
- Added a dropdown menu to the options window that lets you change the anchor point for 'On Anchor' style tooltips. This does the same thing as right clicking on the anchor frame.
- Added a dropdown menu to the options window that lets you change the anchor point for 'On Mouse' style tooltips.
- Once the anchor frame has been hidden, 'On Anchor' style tooltips are now displayed in the same location as the anchor frame. This will allow you to position tooltips at the edge of the screen without having to drag the anchor frame off the screen. Prior to this change, the tooltip was displayed in the same place it was shown when the anchor frame was visible. You may want to adjust the position of your anchor frame to compensate for this change.

CT_Core (3.308)

Objectives window
- Updated to work with the WoW 3.3.3 patch.
- Removed CT_Core's right-click menu from the objectives window to prevent taint issues related to the "Show quest objectives" option on the World Map. Use /ctcore to change the options.

- Added a resize control to the bottom left corner of the objectives window.

- Added an option to control whether or not you can change the width of the Objectives window. This option is disabled by default. Enabling this option may result in an "action blocked by an addon" message if you are in combat when you open the World Map, reduce the size of the World Map, or toggle the "Show quest objectives" option on the World Map.
- Added an option to enable/disable player notes in the Friends window (default is enabled).
- Added an option to enable/disable player notes in the Ignore window (default is enabled).

- Fixed a problem with the 'Hide chat arrows' option that was causing it to sometimes not keep the arrows hidden.

CT_Core (3.305)
- Fixed a problem with the initial positioning of the objectives frame after a login or reload of the ui, if the top left corner of the frame was moved near the vertical or horizontal middle of the screen prior to the logout or reload.
- Added options to open/close all bags when the trade window opens/closes.

CT_Core (3.304)
- Added options to open/close all bags when the auction house opens/closes.

CT_Core (3.303)

Objectives window
- The options for the Objectives window are now disabled by default. This is to prevent any problems that might arise from having other addons loaded that also try to manipulate the Objectives window.
- To enable the Objectives window options, type /ctcore, scroll down to the Objectives section, and select "Enable these options".
- Display issues or other errors may arise if you have more than one addon that tries to manipulate the Objectives window. If that happens, you may need to disable Objectives window options in either CT_Core or some other addon.
- Changed the method CT_Core uses to move the Objectives window in order to try and prevent other addons from immediately repositioning the window when CT_Core moves it.

- Added a texture to the spot where you click to resize the Objectives window (when it is unlocked).

CT_Core (3.302)
- The 'open all bags when merchant opens' option now specifically opens the backpack, even though the game normally opens the backpack anyway at a merchant. This should force the backpack open for anyone who's backpack was not opening for some reason.

CT_Core (3.301)
- Added options for the game's Objectives window. You can now move and resize the window, display a border around it, keep it from being dragged off screen, and change the color and opacity of the window. You can right click the title of the Objectives window to access a menu of options.

CT_Core (3.300)

- Updated for the WoW 3.3 patch.

- Added an option to open a Trade window with your target when you Alt left-click an item. Once the window opens, the item will automatically be added to the Trade window.
- Added an option to add an item to the Trade window when you Alt left-click an item.

CT_Libary.lua (3.005)

Settings import
- Fixed a problem with the settings import feature in the CTMod Control Panel where it was not properly importing frame positions.
- Fixed a problem where there would be more than one "Settings Import" item listed in the CTMod Control Panel when more than one version of CT_Library.lua was encountered.
- The settings import window now defaults to the first character on the first server that has importable options.
- Added the ability to delete settings.

Slash command
- Added the /ctmod command as an alternative to the existing /ct command. Either one will open the CTMod Control Panel.
- Added code to allow direct access to an addon's options window via a slash command (refer to individual addons for any slash commands that may have been added).

- The scrollbar in the options window resets to the top when you select a different addon.
