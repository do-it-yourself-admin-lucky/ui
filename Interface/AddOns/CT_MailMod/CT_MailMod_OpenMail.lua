-- The frame is being hidden.

-- In the MailFrame.xml file, Blizzard specifies the OnHide
-- script handler for the OpenMailFrame as follows:
-- 	<OnHide function="OpenMailFrame_OnHide"/>
-- That syntax causes it to assign a reference to the function.
--
-- We want to alter the internal behaviour of the OpenMailFrame_OnHide
-- function, so a post hook of the function doesn't do us any good.
-- Plus, a posthook of their function would never get called due to
-- the syntax they used in the xml for the OnHide script handler
-- (each time the OnHide script is executed they are calling a
-- reference to the function, rather than looking up the global
-- function name).
--
-- We can't just create a replacement OpenMailFrame_OnHide function
-- due to the syntax they used for the OnHide script handler in the
-- xml file (the OnHide script handler has been assigned a reference
-- to the original function).
--
-- So, in addition to creating a replacement OpenMailFrame_OnHide function,
-- we will also need to assign a new OnHide script handler that will
-- call our replacement function.


-- Replace the OpenMailFrame_OnHide function with our own version.
--
-- Most of the code is the same as the original function.
-- New lines of code are surrounded by, or ended with: -- *new*
-- Modified lines of code are surrounded by, or ended with: -- *mod*

		--
		-- The textCreated property is true for all returned mail (even if the text
		-- attachment was never taken, and even if it never had any text in it),
		-- for mail where the text attachment was taken, for "auction successful"
		-- mail (which has no text), and for "auction won" mail (which has no text).
		--
		-- However, deleting a mail when the OpenMailFrame is being hidden, could
		-- cause problems for us.
		--
		--   The user might have messages selected in the inbox, and deleting a mail
		--   could cause the remaining mail in the inbox to shift, resulting in the
		--   wrong messages being selected.
		--
		--   We may still be processing mail when the OpenMailFrame gets closed.
		--   We don't want the mail to be deleted while we are still working with it.
		--
		-- Also, since returned mail without text will auto delete when the last item is
		-- taken from it, there is no need to try and delete it here as well.
		--
		-- To avoid these types of problems, mail containing text should be manually
		-- deleted by the user via the "Delete" button on the OpenMailFrame (instead of
		-- clicking the close button), or by using the "x" button below the expiry time
		-- on the inbox window.
