- When you take items from a mail, delete a mail, or return a mail, the addon will disable certain buttons to prevent them from being used until the requested action has finished processing.
- If the server is taking too long to respond to a request from the addon, the current action may timeout causing the processing to be cancelled. The default timeout period is 30 seconds.
- You can manually cancel the processing of an action at any time by clicking the Cancel button on the Inbox window, or by closing the mailbox.

- The text indicating that you have a lot of mail in your inbox is now displayed in the chat window when the mailbox opens, instead of at the top of the inbox window.

- Automatically retrieving items from a message should no longer cause "item not found" or "database" error messages.

Message icons (inbox)
- Added an option to show all attachments in message icon tooltips. Note: The game only supports displaying 10 icons in tooltips so the 11th and 12th items in the tooltip will not have an icon.
- You can now use Ctrl click on a message icon to return the message to the sender.
- You can still use Alt click on a message icon to take the contents of the message (Shift click will also work).
- The left or right mouse button can be used when doing a Ctrl click, Shift click, or Alt click on a message.
