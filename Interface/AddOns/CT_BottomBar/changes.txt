CT_BottomBar (4.0100) 2011-04-26

- Updated for the WoW 4.1 patch.
- Updated CT_Library.lua to version 4.0100.
- This version includes all the changes that were in the CT_BottomBar 4.008 betas.

In order to resolve vehicle and shapeshifting issues related to the game's default main action bar, CT_BottomBar version 4.0100 no longer supports moving the default main action bar.

To provide a movable replacement for the game's main action bar, a new bar (bar 12) has been added to CT_BarMod version 4.0100. This new bar behaves like the default main action bar, and it can automatically use the same key bindings.

NOTE: If you previously only used CT_BottomBar, you should now also install CT_BarMod if you want to use CT_BarMod's bar 12 as a replacement main action bar. If you don't install CT_BarMod you will still be able to use the default main action bar, but it won't be movable.

The first time that the new version of CT_BottomBar is used, it will check to see if the new version of CT_BarMod is also installed. If both addons are installed, then CT_BottomBar will disable the default main action bar, enable CT_BarMod's bar 12, and apply any saved settings for CT_BottomBar's old action bar to the new CT_BarMod bar.

If the initial defaults do not work for you the first time CT_BottomBar is started, then you can enable or disable the default main action bar using a new option found in CT_BottomBar. There is also a new option in CT_BarMod that will allow you to enable or disable CT_BarMod's replacement for the default main action bar (bar 12).

General
- Added an option to hide the artwork on the left half of the game's MainMenuBar (behind the action buttons).
- Added an option to hide the artwork on the right half of the game's MainMenuBar (behind the action bar page buttons, menu buttons, key ring button, and bag buttons).

Activating and deactivating bars
- Most bars now have an 'Activate' option which is turned on by default.
- When a bar is activated, CT_BottomBar will let you move and rotate the bar.
- When you deactivate a bar, CT_BottomBar will try to restore the bar to its default state. If the bar does not restore as expected then you may need to reload your UI once (/reload).

Action Bar
- Added an option to disable the default main action bar. Changes to this option will not take effect until addons are reloaded (/reload).

Bags Bar
- Added an option to hide all buttons except for the backpack. This will also change the size of the bar.

Vehicle Tools Bar
- You can now choose whether or not to include room on the bar for the two possible aiming buttons.

Miscellaneous
- When you drag a bar while the options window is open, the tooltip will become hidden until the mouse button is released.
- Added an option to show drag frames for CT_BarMod bars when the CT_BottomBar options window is open. This option will only appear if CT_BarMod is loaded as well.

CT_BottomBar (4.004) 2010-10-24

CT_BottomBar allows you to move the default action bar anywhere on the screen. Since the 4.0.1. patch, classes that can shapeshift, change stances, etc. and who do so during combat, sometimes find that their action buttons get stuck at the bottom of the screen. This is happening because Blizzard slides the bar down, positions it at the bottom of the screen, and then attaches the buttons to it. Since these buttons are protected, CT_BottomBar cannot move them back while you are in combat. Once combat ends the buttons should automatically go back to where you had placed them.

This CT_BottomBar update adds some options that will prevent Blizzard from being able to move the buttons. While it is not a perfect solution, it may help those people currently experiencing this issue. Please see the change notes below for the details.

- Added an option to prevent Blizzard from moving the bonus action bar's buttons when you shapeshift, change stances, etc.
- Added an option to prevent Blizzard from changing the spacing of the bonus action bar's buttons when you shapeshift, change stances, etc. This will also prevent a vertical action bar from becoming horizontal during combat.
- When enabled, these options may cause 'action blocked by an addon' errors, and they may lead to other interface issues.
- These options are disabled by default to avoid potential interface issues for people that don't need to use these options.
- The 'move' option is the one least likely to cause any issues, and should be tried first.
- The 'spacing' option will cause at least one 'action blocked' message, and is more likely to cause interface issues.
- If you change these options while you are in combat, they may have no effect until you exit combat.
- If these options cause any issues that are not acceptable then you will need to disable one or both of the options.
- If you disable either of these options after having them enabled, you should reload your UI (/reload) or logout and login once.

Slash command
- Added the /ctmod command as an alternative to the existing /ct command. Either one will open the CTMod Control Panel.
- Added code to allow direct access to an addon's options window via a slash command (refer to individual addons for any slash commands that may have been added).

General
