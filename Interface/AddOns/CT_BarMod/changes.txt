- When playing as a rogue, bar 7 is now shown in the options window as 'stealth, shadow dance'.
- When playing as a rogue, bar 8 is now shown in the options window as 'general purpose'.

Bar paging (basic options):
- The Alt, Ctrl, and Shift key options in the Basic Paging options now extend up to action page 14.
- Refer to the next section for a description of action pages 11 through 14.

Bar paging (advanced):
- Blizzard made some changes to action bar pages in WoW 5.
- These changes should not affect you if you are using the basic paging/visibility options for the bars in CT_BarMod.
- These changes may affect you if you are using the advanced paging/visibility options for the bars in CT_BarMod.
- Action page 11 used to be associated with the '[bonusbar:5]' macro condition and the vehicle, bonus, and possess abilities.
- Action page 11 is now associated with multicast abilities (like the totem bar in WoW 4).
- Action page 12 is new. It is associated with vehicle and possess abilities.
- Action page 13 is new. It is associated with temporary shapeshift abilities.
- Action page 14 is new. It is associated with override abilities.

Bar macro conditions (advanced):
- Blizzard made some changes to action bar related macro conditions in WoW 5.
- These changes should not affect you if you are using the basic paging/visibility options for the bars in CT_BarMod.
- These changes may affect you if you are using the advanced paging/visibility options for the bars in CT_BarMod.
- The macro condition '[vehicleui]' is still used for detecting vehicle abilities (action page 12).
- Blizzard added the macro condition '[possessbar]' for detecting possess and vehicle abilities (both use action page 12).
- There is currently no macro condition available for detecting temporary shapeshift abilities (action page 13).
- Blizzard added the macro condition '[overridebar]' for detecting override abilities (action page 14).
- Blizzard added the macro condition '[petbattle]' for detecting pet battles (there is no action page number for this).
- The old macro condition '[bonusbar:5]' no longer works for detecting vehicle, bonus, or possess abilities.
- You can replace '[bonusbar:5]' with '[vehicleui][overridebar][possessbar]' if you want to detect the same types of abilities as before. However, keep in mind that the override abilities are on a different action page than the vehicle and possess abilities.
- You can replace '[bonusbar:5]' with '[possessbar]' if you only want to detect possess and vehicle abilities (these both use the same action page).
- For now, CT_BarMod will automatically replace the text '[bonusbar:5]11' with '[possessbar]12', and '[bonusbar:5]' with '[possessbar]' before using an advanced condition with a bar.

Skinning buttons
- CT_BarMod buttons can now be skinned using either CT_BarMod or a non-CTMod addon named Masque (formerly Button Facade).
- Two basic skins are included with CT_BarMod. You do not need Masque to use these two skins.
- If Masque is loaded, the two CT_BarMod skins will also be present in Masque's skins menu.

- Some variables and functions which were global are now correctly declared as local.

- Shift, Ctrl, and Alt modifiers in macros now work with CT_BarMod key bindings.

- Added an option to shift the standard focus frame to the right.

- Added an option to change the default set of bar positions that you are using. Enabling/disabling this option does not change the current position of the bars. To move the bars to the chosen default positions you have to also click the 'Reset group positions' button.

- Added an option that allows you to choose whether or not you want to hide the CT_BarMod bars when Blizzard's vehicle frame appears. By default, the bars are hidden just like in the standard UI. Refer to the notes below the option for more details.
- If you are using TitanPanel, CT_BarMod's bottom left and bottom right bars will take into account the height of the bottom TitanPanel bar when you reset the positions of the CT_BarMod bars.
- Added some color, font, style and size options for the cooldown counts.
- Added options to reset the CT_BarMod options for your current character or for all characters.
