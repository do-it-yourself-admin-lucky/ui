CT_BuffMod (4.0301) 2011-11-27
- Updated for the WoW 4.3 patch.
- Added an option which allows you to use unsecure buff buttons.
- Added an option (for unsecure buffs only) that lets you sort non-expiring buffs before, after, or with the other buffs in the same sorting group.

- When using unsecure buff buttons:

a) You can only cancel buffs when not in combat. This is a game restriction.
b) You cannot cancel weapon buffs. This is a game restriction.
c) When sorting by time, CT_BuffMod will also sort by name if the times are the same.
d) Unusecure buff buttons are not affected by the current bugs in Blizzard's Secure Aura routines (see below).

- You can use unsecure buff buttons to emulate the "Auras" buff group that was available in older versions of CT_BuffMod as follows:

a) Enable the "Use unsecure buff buttons" option for the window.
b) Group the buffs as "All buffs". Don't use "Canceleable buffs" or "Uncancelable buffs".
c) Set the "Buffs that you cast" option to "With other players".
d) Set the "Non-expiring buffs" option to "After other buffs".

- Blizzard finally fixed some of the bugs in their Secure Aura routines. As a result the following items are now implemented in CT_BuffMod:

a) The off hand weapon enchant button should now display and cancel properly.
b) The ranged weapon enchant button should now display and cancel properly.
c) You can now sort buffs that you cast, with buffs cast by others. Refer to the "Buffs you can cast" option in the "Sorting" section of the CT_BuffMod options. The default for this option is now "Sort with others".

- NOTE: There are still some bugs in Blizzard's Secure Aura routines on the 4.3 PTR as of Nov 27, 2011. It is not known if the bugs will be fixed before 4.3 gets released. Below are some issues you may experience due to these bugs.

1) If you show consolidated or weapon buttons in a CT_BuffMod window...

1a) If a buff fades or is cancelled, the final buff button in the window may not get hidden. The button may continue to show a duplicate buff or a buff that is no longer applicable.

1b) If there was a consolidated or weapon button positioned after the non-hidden button, then you may end up with the two buttons occupying the same spot in the window. You can work around this by showing the consolidated and weapon buttons before the other buff groups.

2) If you show weapon buttons in a CT_BuffMod window...

2a) If you gain a ranged weapon buff, the weapon buff button may not get shown in the window until you gain or lose another buff.


CT_BuffMod (4.0200) 2011-06-28
- Updated version numbers for the WoW 4.2 patch.

CT_BuffMod (4.0101) 2011-04-26
- Fixed a bug that was causing an error when logging into the game for some people.

CT_BuffMod (4.0100) 2011-04-26

- Updated for the WoW 4.1 patch.
- Updated CT_Library.lua to version 4.0100.
- This version includes all the changes that were in the CT_BuffMod 4.003 and 4.004 betas.

If you were using the beta version:
- The default buff window layout is now different than it was in the beta. As a result, you might need to adjust your layout options.
- The beta layout defaults were for a single column with a fixed height (Layout = 'Top to bottom. Wrap right', Buffs per column = 19, Number of columns = 1).
- The new layout defaults are for a single column with a variable height (Layout = 'Left to right. Wrap down', Buffs per row = 1, Number of rows = 0).

General
- The addon now uses Blizzard's Secure Aura Header routines so that you can cancel a buff using a Right-click.
- Due to the use of secure buttons, there are a number of options which if changed will not have any effect until you are out of combat.

Colors
- Added an option to select a color for the consolidated window.
- Added an option to select a color for the consolidated bar.

Expiration
- You can now configure when a fading icon begins to flash.

Windows
- You can now add, clone, or delete a buff window.
- Disabling a window will delete the window but retain its options.
- If you Alt Left-click on a CT_BuffMod window, the addon will open the options window and automatically select the window you clicked.

Units
- For a "player" buff window, you can now choose whether or not you want to show vehicle buffs when you are in a vehicle.
- You can now create a separate window just for vehicle buffs.

Visibility
- You can now control whether to hide or show a buff window based on macro conditions.

Sorting
- You can now choose to sort buffs that you have cast, before or after those cast by others. A third option (sort WITH the buffs cast by other people) is currently not available due to a bug in Blizzard's routines.

- When grouping items, the new 'cancelable buffs' group is comparable to the old 'buffs' type in the previous versions of CT_BuffMod. These are usually buffs that have a duration, but will also include things like mounts. The game (not the addon) determines which buffs are cancelable. The game may include some buffs in this group that cannot be cancelled with a right-click.

- When grouping items, the new 'uncancelable buffs' group is comparable to the old 'auras' type. These are usually buffs that have no expiration time. The game (not the addon) determines which buffs are uncancelable.

- Added consolidated button support as one of the sorting groups. When you mouse over the consolidated button in the buff window it will display a consolidated buffs window.

- If weapons buffs and the consolidated button end up beside each other in the buff window, the weapon buffs will appear first in the buff window even if they are listed after the consolidated button in the options window. The order is controlled by Blizzard's Secure Aura Header routines.

- When sorting by time, Blizzard's routines treat buffs with no duration (like mounts) as having 0 time remaining.

Consolidated buffs
- You can now choose to display a consolidated button as one of the sorting groups.

- If you enable the consolidated button, then the game will move some buffs into a separate consolidated window that will be displayed when you mouse over the consolidated button.

- Although the game (not the addon) decides which buffs get moved into the consolidated window, there are some options available to influence that decision.

- Refer to the '?' buttons in the CT_BuffMod options window for some more details about consolidation.

Window appearance
- You can now control the left, right, top, and bottom distance between the buffs and the window border.
- You can now choose from eight different layout types that control the arrangement of buttons in the window.
- Left-to-right and Right-to-left layouts arrange the buffs horizontally in rows with a fixed width. The number of rows can be fixed or variable.
- Top-to-bottom and Bottom-to-top layouts arrange the buffs vertically in columns with a fixed height. The number of columns can be fixed or variable.
- You can control the distance between buffs in the same row or column.
- You can control the distance between rows or columns.

Button appearance
- You can now choose from two styles of buttons: a button and a bar, or just a button.
- You can now color code the border of debuff icons (the color is based on the type of debuff: curse, magic, etc).
- You can now color code debuff bars (the color is based on the type of debuff: curse, magic, etc).
- Added more options for justifying the name and time remaining text on a bar.
- Added more options for the location of the time remaining text on a bar.
- Added options to control the text offset on the left and right sides of the bar.
- When using the new button style you can configure the icon size, color code the border of debuff icons, show time remaining text, and configure the time format, location and offset from the icon.

Known issues
- Blizzard's secure aura routines currently assign the main-hand slot number to the off-hand weapon's buff button. This causes the main-hand buff to be cancelled when you right click the off-hand buff button. Until Blizzard fixes the bug, a workaround has been added to CT_BuffMod that will correct the slot number, however it can only do so when you are not in combat.

- Blizzard's secure aura routines do not currently support temporary enchants on a ranged weapon.

- Blizzard's secure aura routines support a third way to sort the buffs that you cast (sort WITH the buffs cast by other people). However, this third sort method is currently not available due to a bug in Blizzard's routines.
